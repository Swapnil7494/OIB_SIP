During my Data Analytics internship at Oasis Infobyte , I eagerly delved into data interpretation and analysis, gaining critical insights and skills through a series of challenging projects. This internship provided practical, hands-on experience, equipping me with the tools and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of data analysis.

Projects:

1.Customer Segmentation Analysis: In this project, I performed customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company by analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns. The goal was to group customers into distinct segments, enabling the company to implement targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies. This project deepened my understanding of customer behavior analytics and the strategic value of segmentation in business operations.

2.Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression:The objective of this project was to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on a dataset with relevant features. This project provided hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model using a fundamental machine learning algorithm. It significantly enhanced my understanding of the model-building process and the practical application of linear regression in predictive analytics.

3.Unveiling the Android App Market: Analyzing Google Play Store Data:This project involved cleaning, categorizing, and visualizing Google Play Store data to gain in-depth insights into app market dynamics. By leveraging data analytics, visualization, and enhanced interpretation skills, I was able to better understand the Android app market and its trends.
